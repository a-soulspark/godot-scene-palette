## Using Scene Palette
#### Navigating to a new Palette
Using the file browser on top, navigate to the folder containing scenes for
your palette. The plugin will create a palette automatically using the scenes
in this folder. Nested folders are also allowed. To save a favorite directory
for easy access, click the heart button next to the file browser.

#### Using a Palette
Dragging and dropping scenes from the Scene Palette induces the same behavior
as dragging and dropping `.tscn` files from the file browser. But the scene
palette allows you to see scene previews and save favorites.

The Scene Palette Plugin is essentially an alternative file browser with tiled
thumbnails, making it easier to see all your scenes at once.
