## Using Scene Palette
The Scene Palette Plugin is essentially an alternative file browser with tiled
thumbnails, making it easier to see all your scenes at once.

Dragging and dropping scenes from the Scene Palette induces the same behavior
as dragging and dropping `.tscn` files from the file browser, so you can take
advantage of the same keyboard shortcuts, such as holding `ctrl` when dropping
a file to add it as a child of the currently selected node.

#### Navigating to a new Palette
Using the file browser on top, navigate to the folder containing scenes for
your palette. The plugin will create a palette automatically using the scenes
in this folder. Nested folders are also allowed. 

Press the heart button next to the file selector to save this directory to your
favorites. You can change the colors of your favorite palettes to diferrentiate
them and saved palettes will persist when closing and reopening the editor.
